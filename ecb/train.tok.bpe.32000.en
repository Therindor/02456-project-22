Research
The result of this process is due to be announced in September .
Interest income in 2006 improved as a result of the increase in the marginal rate for the Eurosystem ’ s main refinancing operations , which determines the remuneration that the ECB receives on its share of euro banknotes in the Eurosystem , and higher interest rates on US dollar-denominated assets .
Banks will be expected to cover capital shortfalls within six to nine months after the disclosure of the results of the comprehensive assessment .
The ECB is seeking a su@@ itable candidate of recognised standing and experience in banking supervision and financial matters .

In accordance with the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank , Eesti Pank has paid up the remainder of its contribution to the capital of the ECB and transferred its contribution to the foreign reserve assets of the ECB .
The principal factor contributing to this decrease was the depreciation of the US dollar vis-à-vis the euro in the latter part of 2002 .
This requirement must be fulfilled on average over the l@@ eng@@ th of the maintenance period .
Furthermore , it would be benefi@@ cial for the adoption of SEPA if they use BICs and IBANs for making payments ( preferably with SEPA payment instruments ) whenever they are indicated on invoices .
Counterfeits can be easily distinguished from genuine banknotes by using the simple FEEL-LOOK-TILT test described in the Eurosystem ’ s publications and on the ECB ’ s website and the websites of the Eurosystem national central banks .

The agreed amendment will then be recommended to the Member States for ratification in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements .
In particular , it ensures equal treatment of all printing works wishing to participate in the single Eurosystem tender procedure , as well as transparency and efficiency .
During the past six months , the share of counterfeit € 20 banknotes increased and the share of € 50 banknotes decreased .
A h@@ ard co@@ p@@ y can also be obtained by writing to the ECB &apos;s Press and Information Division at the address given below .
The significantly higher write-downs in 2013 were mainly due to the overall decrease in the market values of the securities held in the ECB ’ s US dollar portfolio .
Compared with the figures reported for the second half of 2014 , the proportion of counterfeit € 20 notes decreased slightly and that of counterfeit € 50 notes increased .
As these issues are not treated uniformly in the different national j@@ ur@@ is@@ dic@@ tions , legal requirements and the way those requirements are met may vary from country to country .
In the event of doubt , third parties may se@@ ek confirmation from the ECB or the National Central Banks of the euro area that the reproductions are allowed .

As regards general government debt , only Hungary exhibited a debt ratio above the 60 % of GDP reference value in 2007 ; in the other countries debt ratios were lower .
The analysis of the deviations of annual M3 growth from the reference value represents an important element in the evaluation of monetary developments and their implications for future price stability .
The ECB will therefore continue to evaluate thoroughly the course of events in light of its mandate .
While the mission did not undertake a comprehensive review at this time , its discussions su@@ gg@@ est that the programme is on track and that policies are being implemented as agreed :
As a first step , the Governing Council decided to include in the Eurosystem collateral framework a new category of previously ineligible assets ( euro-denominated debt instruments issued by entities established in those Group of Ten countries that are not part of the European Economic Area ) .
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be decreased by 25 basis points to 0.75 % , starting from the operation to be settled on 11 July 2012 .
The Eurosystem ’ s holdings of securities held for monetary policy purposes increased by € 586 billion to € 803 billion ( 2014 : € 217 billion ) .
The interest rate on the deposit facility will be increased by 25 basis points to 1.75 % , with effect from 15 June 2006 .
Pro@@ mot@@ ing the use of efficient retail payment services is a key objective for the ECB and the national central banks of the Eurosystem and it can provide concrete economic benefits .

At the end of the t@@ wel@@ fth edition of the EUROPEAN CULTURAL DAYS , the two pat@@ r@@ ons expressed their thank@@ s to the artists , sponsors and organisation teams that made all the events happen .
It also included net interest income of € 120 million ( 2014 : € 173 million ) arising from securities purchased under the first two covered bond purchase programmes and € 161 million arising from securities purchased under the expanded asset purchase programme ( APP ) ( 2014 : € 2 million ) .
In order to smooth the transfer of capital to the ECB , the Governing Council decided that the euro area national central banks ( NCBs ) should pay their additional capital contributions of € 3,@@ 48@@ 9,@@ 57@@ 5,000 in three equal annual instal@@ ments .
The P@@ S@@ D will reinforce the rights and protection of all the users of payment services ( consumers , retailers , large and small companies and public authorities ) .
The share of the other denominations ( € 5 , € 10 , € 200 and € 500 ) remains very low .
Approximately 0.5 % were found in EU Member States outside the euro area and the remainder in other parts of the world .
Such fees are given to charities .
As before , the Governing Council will assess monetary developments in relation to the reference value on the basis of a three-month moving average of annual growth rates .
No phasing-out rules for these assets are therefore required at the mo@@ ment .
The Eurosystem continues to inv@@ est much effort in ensuring that both the public and the professional cash handling community are well informed about how to recognise a counterfeit banknote .
When compared with the increasing number of genuine euro banknotes in circulation ( on average 13.@@ 6 billion during the second half of 2010 ) , the proportion of counterfeits remains very low .
The Governing Council decided to make an interim profit distribution , amounting to € 841 million , to the euro area national central banks ( NCBs ) on 30 January 2015 .

All parties agreed that the future memorial should not inter@@ fer@@ e with the functioning of the ECB .
For this reason the Governing Council already made it clear in 1998 that the announcement of the reference value does not entail a commitment on the part of the ECB to correct mechanistically deviations of monetary growth from the reference value .
These statistics had origin@@ ally been defined by the European Monetary Institute ( the predecessor of the ECB ) as the minimum that the ECB would require for monetary policy purposes at the start of Monetary Union .

The decrease in realised gains arising from financial operations in 2013 was due mainly to lower realised price gains generated on the US dollar portfolio .
So far , only a few cru@@ de reproductions of euro banknotes have been put into circulation and were detected without difficul@@ ty .
The new distribution of the NCBs ’ shares in the ECB ’ s capital key is set out in the table attached to this press release .

The same mandate has been given to the European Commission and the two reports have been submitted to the EU Council in parallel .
For media enquiries , please contact Andrea Jürges on + 49 69 1344 8334 .
This reduction was partially offset by securities purchased under the third covered bond purchase programme and the ABSPP which comm@@ enced in late 2014 and amounted to € 3@@ 1.3 billion at the year-end .
There has been no significant change to the overall distribution pattern : as in previous half years , 97 % of counterfeits in circulation were found in the euro area ; a further 1 % came from other EU Member States outside the euro area ; and 2 % came from the “ rest of the world ” , mainly from countries neighbouring the EU .
The reference value for monetary growth is an important part of the first pillar of the strategy , which assigns a prominent role to the analysis of monetary developments .
The Governing Council had no objections to the proposed candidate , Mr José Manuel González-Páramo , who is a person of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters , as required by Article 112 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community .
During the first six months of this year ( i.e. since the euro banknotes and coins were first put into circulation ) 2@@ 1,@@ 965 counterfeit euro banknotes were recorded .
In accordance with Article 49.3 of the Statute of the ESCB , which was added to the Statute by the Treaty of Accession , the ECB ’ s subscribed capital is automatically increased when a new Member State joins the EU and its NCB joins the ESCB .
When pay@@ ing at the point of sale , card payments should be used , instead of less efficient means of payment , both for national and SEPA-wide transactions .

Accounting policies of the ECB and the Eurosystem : Common accounting policies have been established by the Governing Council for the Eurosystem , including the ECB , in accordance with Article 26.4 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank ( Statute of the ESCB ) , and have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union . &#91; 2 &#93; Although generally based on internationally accepted accounting practice , these policies are designed with special regard to the unique circumstances of the central banks of the Eurosystem .
The vast majority of the costs incurred in connection with the construction of the ECB ’ s new premises have been capitalised and are excluded from this item .
With regard to the second measure on the acceptability of non-regulated markets , a preliminary list of accepted non-regulated markets was published by the ECB on 10 May 2004 ( see the press release “ Review of the Eurosystem ’ s Collateral Framework : First step towards a Single List ” ) .
The new Regulation will include a number of essential enhancements to the statistical requirements .
Excluding the interest income of € 2,@@ 004 million earned on the share of banknotes in circulation , net interest income amounted to € 417 million , compared with € 653 million in 2006 .
Such measures , together with stability-oriented macroeconomic policies , will help to achieve an environment conducive to sustainable price stability , as well as promote competitiveness and employment growth .
Finally , considerable progress has been made in the fields of e-@@ payments and m@@ ob@@ ile payments .
In the context of the review of the reference value , the Governing Council wishes to recall the following features of the reference value and its role in the ECB &apos;s monetary policy strategy .

All euro area NCBs are required to follow these policies for the purpose of reporting their operations as part of the Eurosystem , which are included in the Eurosystem ’ s weekly consolidated financial statements .
The amendments will apply from 30 May 2005 when the new version of the General Documentation replaces the previous version published in February 2004 .
The Eurosystem will , however , continue to provide the bulk of liquidity through its main refinancing operations .
The ECB ’ s regular income derives mainly from investment earnings on its foreign reserve assets and its own funds portfolio , from interest income on its 8 % share of the total euro banknotes in circulation , and from net interest income arising from securities purchased for monetary policy purposes under the covered bond purchase programme ( starting from July 2009 ) and the Securities Markets Programme ( starting from May 2010 ) .
For all other 3,@@ 500 banks the ECB will also set and monitor the supervisory standards and work closely with the national competent authorities in the supervision of these banks .

Notes
Rest@@ oring competitiveness and boo@@ sting potential growth remains critical to the programme ’ s success .
Several studies have provided empirical evidence in support of this role and confirm that the conditions for announcing a reference value ( stable money demand relationship and leading indicator properties of M3 for future inflation ) are satisfied for the euro area .
The recent pick@@ -up in the rate of growth of M3 can be expla@@ ined partly as an adjustment of M3 following a sh@@ ar@@ p increase in the price level resulting from the oil and food price shocks in the euro area and partly as a consequence of the effects of portfolio shifts .
Meetings of the General Council of the ECB in 2012

A video entitled “ Discover the new € 20 banknote ” in 23 European Union languages provides further information on the new note and how to check it .
The Governing Council decided to reconfirm the existing reference value for monetary growth , namely an annual growth rate of 4 1 / 2 % for the broad aggregate M3 .
These interest rates will be used to assess the degree of convergence of these countries , as required under Article 121 of the Treaty establishing the European Community ( the Treaty ) .
