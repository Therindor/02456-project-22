The interest rate on the deposit facility will be decreased by 50 basis points to 2.75 % , with effect from 12 November 2008 .
At the same time , the Eurosystem , i.e. the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the 15 national central banks of the euro area , continues to advise the public to be alert and to check the authenticity of the banknotes that they receive .
Fin@@ alisation of the New ECB Premises is foreseen for the end of 2011 .
&#91; 1 &#93; The number of banknotes in circulation is expla@@ ined in further detail on the ECB ’ s website at http : / / www.ecb.europa.eu / stats / euro / circulation / html / index.en.html

It is one of several cash-@@ related vi@@ de@@ os available at www.new-euro-banknotes.eu , which also offers other ways of lear@@ n@@ ing about the banknotes , such as the “ Euro C@@ as@@ h Ac@@ adem@@ y ” .
The comprehensive assessment results will be published in the second half of October , after having been end@@ or@@ sed by the ECB .
The euro progress ratio – EP@@ R – reached 65 % on 24 January 2002 , up from 33 % on 1 January .
When compared with the increasing number of genuine euro banknotes in circulation ( on average 13@@ .2 billion during the first half of 2010 ) , the proportion of counterfeits remains very low .
Achiev@@ ing an environment conducive to sustainable convergence in Slovakia requires , inter alia , the implementation of a sustainable and credible fiscal consolidation path .
The ECB launched the project in 1998 with the search for a su@@ itable site in Frankfurt am Main .
The purpose of the risk provision is to cover foreign exchange rate , interest rate , credit and gold price risks , which are monitored on an on-going basis .
It is therefore not possible at this juncture to conclu@@ sively assess the short and medium-term implications for the euro area .
All members of the Governing Council will continue to attend meetings in a per@@ s@@ onal and independent capacity , and the &quot; one member , one vote &quot; principle will continue to apply to NCB Governors exercising a voting right .
