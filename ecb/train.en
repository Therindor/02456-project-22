The final decision of the Governing Council will be formally adopted in the form of an ECB Recommendation as soon as the Treaty of Nice enters into force and will be submitted to the EU Council.

Instead, it has interpreted the general tier one eligibility criterion stipulating that debt instruments must have “a fixed, unconditional principal amount” as excluding those asset-backed securities in which the credit risk has been transferred to a special purpose vehicle using credit derivatives.
Against this background, the Governing Council wishes to emphasise that the trend growth potential of the euro area could be considerably enhanced by structural reform in the labour and goods markets.

The agreed amendment will then be recommended to the Member States for ratification in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.
In particular, it ensures equal treatment of all printing works wishing to participate in the single Eurosystem tender procedure, as well as transparency and efficiency.
During the past six months, the share of counterfeit €20 banknotes increased and the share of €50 banknotes decreased.
A hard copy can also be obtained by writing to the ECB's Press and Information Division at the address given below.
The significantly higher write-downs in 2013 were mainly due to the overall decrease in the market values of the securities held in the ECB’s US dollar portfolio.
Compared with the figures reported for the second half of 2014, the proportion of counterfeit €20 notes decreased slightly and that of counterfeit €50 notes increased.
As these issues are not treated uniformly in the different national jurisdictions, legal requirements and the way those requirements are met may vary from country to country.
In the event of doubt, third parties may seek confirmation from the ECB or the National Central Banks of the euro area that the reproductions are allowed.
These will begin at the end of March 2006 and are scheduled for completion in July.
As regards general government debt, only Hungary exhibited a debt ratio above the 60% of GDP reference value in 2007; in the other countries debt ratios were lower.
The analysis of the deviations of annual M3 growth from the reference value represents an important element in the evaluation of monetary developments and their implications for future price stability.
The ECB will therefore continue to evaluate thoroughly the course of events in light of its mandate.
While the mission did not undertake a comprehensive review at this time, its discussions suggest that the programme is on track and that policies are being implemented as agreed:
As a first step, the Governing Council decided to include in the Eurosystem collateral framework a new category of previously ineligible assets (euro-denominated debt instruments issued by entities established in those Group of Ten countries that are not part of the European Economic Area).
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be decreased by 25 basis points to 0.75%, starting from the operation to be settled on 11 July 2012.
The Eurosystem’s holdings of securities held for monetary policy purposes increased by €586 billion to €803 billion (2014: €217 billion).
The interest rate on the deposit facility will be increased by 25 basis points to 1.75%, with effect from 15 June 2006.
Promoting the use of efficient retail payment services is a key objective for the ECB and the national central banks of the Eurosystem and it can provide concrete economic benefits.

Remuneration of foreign reserve assets transferred to the ECB: On transferring foreign reserve assets to the ECB upon joining the Eurosystem, each NCB acquires a remunerated claim on the ECB equivalent to the amount it transfers.
In SEPA, all euro payments are considered domestic and are made with one set of payment instruments.
In this context, the Eurosystem has conducted liquidity-providing fine tuning operations yesterday and today.

Sovereign exposures in the held-to-maturity portfolios (HTM) will be treated in the same way as other credit exposures in that portfolio, i.e. the impact of the scenarios on the loss and default parameters will be calculated and will result in larger provisions.
The ECB assumes the supervisory tasks conferred on it by the SSM Regulation one year after the Regulation entered into force.
The Eurosystem will, however, continue to provide the bulk of liquidity through its main refinancing operations.
This amount takes into consideration the expected liquidity needs of the euro area banking system in 2003 and reflects the desire of the Eurosystem to continue to provide the bulk of liquidity through its main refinancing operations.
After extensive discussions and a careful evaluation, based on the selection criteria, of the strengths and weaknesses of all three prize-winning designs from the international urban planning and architectural design competition, the Governing Council concluded that the revised design concept of COOP HIMMELB(L)AU best meets the functional and technical requirements specified by the ECB, and has features that reflect the ECB’s values and translate them into architectural language.
Commercial and central banks, as well as payment institutions, should use SEPA instruments and — in case they do not conduct payments autonomously — choose a payments service provider that observes the SEPA rules and expectations.

It also included net interest income of €120 million (2014: €173 million) arising from securities purchased under the first two covered bond purchase programmes and €161 million arising from securities purchased under the expanded asset purchase programme (APP) (2014: €2 million).
In order to smooth the transfer of capital to the ECB, the Governing Council decided that the euro area national central banks (NCBs) should pay their additional capital contributions of €3,489,575,000 in three equal annual instalments.
The PSD will reinforce the rights and protection of all the users of payment services (consumers, retailers, large and small companies and public authorities).
The share of the other denominations (€5, €10, €200 and €500) remains very low.
Approximately 0.5% were found in EU Member States outside the euro area and the remainder in other parts of the world.
Such fees are given to charities.
As before, the Governing Council will assess monetary developments in relation to the reference value on the basis of a three-month moving average of annual growth rates.
No phasing-out rules for these assets are therefore required at the moment.
The Eurosystem continues to invest much effort in ensuring that both the public and the professional cash handling community are well informed about how to recognise a counterfeit banknote.
When compared with the increasing number of genuine euro banknotes in circulation (on average 13.6 billion during the second half of 2010), the proportion of counterfeits remains very low.
The Governing Council decided to make an interim profit distribution, amounting to €841 million, to the euro area national central banks (NCBs) on 30 January 2015.

The interest rate on loans to households for house purchase with over 5 and up to 10 years' initial rate fixation fell by around 60 basis points between January and September 2003, whereas the interest rate on loans to non-financial corporations over EUR 1 million with over 5 years initial rate fixation fell by around 35 basis points during the same period.
All parties agreed that the future memorial should not interfere with the functioning of the ECB.
For this reason the Governing Council already made it clear in 1998 that the announcement of the reference value does not entail a commitment on the part of the ECB to correct mechanistically deviations of monetary growth from the reference value.
These statistics had originally been defined by the European Monetary Institute (the predecessor of the ECB) as the minimum that the ECB would require for monetary policy purposes at the start of Monetary Union.

Exploiting the information content in monetary and credit aggregates helps the central bank to look beyond the transitory impact of various shocks and to maintain a medium-term orientation in monetary policy.
The Eurosystem invests considerable effort in ensuring that the public is well informed about how to recognise a counterfeit banknote and, for professional cash-handlers, that banknote-handling and processing machines can reliably identify and withdraw counterfeits from circulation.

The revised designs were examined by the ECB, in cooperation with its consultants and experts, and by experts from the City of Frankfurt authorities and political representatives.
The overwhelming majority (97%) of counterfeits recovered in the first half of 2007 were again found in euro area countries.
They are the most accessed item on the ECB’s website, with more than a million visits per month.
“Colourful Bulgaria” ‒ programme highlights
Currently, some specific restrictions are imposed on the eligibility of uncovered debt instruments issued by credit institutions.
With this scheme, the ECB aims to support charitable organisations which operate in the social and humanitarian fields, are located in the euro area, are well known and respected, and are not affiliated to any political organisation.
By showing political support and by becoming early adopters of the SEPA products the public sector can play a vital role for the success of the SEPA.
For the customer, it should not make any difference where or with which bank in the euro area the account is held.
None of the countries under review participates in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II).
The interest rate on loans to households for house purchase, with an initial rate fixation of over one year and up to five years, stood at 4.10%.
Over the reference period, the 12-month average rate of HICP inflation in Lithuania was 0.6%, i.e. well below the reference value for the criterion on price stability.

When assessing the sustainability of convergence, the report also takes due account of both the new enhanced economic governance framework of the EU and the strength of the institutional environment in each country, including in the area of statistics.
Extra copies of the leaflet and the motion card can be obtained from the respective national central bank.
Following this ECB opinion and an opinion of the European Parliament, the new ECB President will be appointed by common accord of the governments of the Member States which have adopted the single currency at the level of Heads of State or Government.
[2] Using the sector breakdown from ESA 95 (European System of Accounts 1995), the categories of eligible debtors will be as follows: central government, state/regional government, local government, and non-financial corporations.
These rates are often used for the annual financial statements of corporations, tax returns, statistical reports and economic analyses.
The Regulation will enter into force following approval by the EU Council and publication in the Official Journal of the EU.
The report has also been published, together with the ECB’s reply, in the Official Journal of the European Union dated 29 January 2011 and can be found on the ECB’s website.
The monetary analysis always has to be seen in conjunction with the second pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, which uses other economic and financial indicators in the context of a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability.
During the past six months, the share of counterfeit €20 banknotes decreased and the share of €50 banknotes increased.
The Supervisory Board will be responsible for the planning and execution of the supervisory tasks conferred upon the ECB and its mandate to directly supervise the most significant banks in the euro area.
The jury first drew up a list of ten finalists, from which it then chose three prizewinners for the ECB Annual Photography Award, with prizes worth €10,000 in total.
The ECB has collaborated closely with the EBA on the stress test methodology and with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) who produced the adverse scenario.
Particular attention is given to the issue of prudence, owing to the large foreign exchange exposures of most of the Eurosystem central banks.
The official series of M3 (which is now adjusted for all non-euro area residents' holdings of negotiable instruments) exhibits all the desired properties, i.e. a stable money demand relationship and good leading indicator properties for future price developments at medium-term horizons.
Reserve base data for credit institutions reporting monthly
Regulation ECB/2003/10 amends Regulation ECB/2001/13 of 22 November 2001 concerning the consolidated balance sheet of the monetary financial institutions sector.
The Eurosystem’s holdings of securities held for monetary policy purposes decreased by €19 billion to €217 billion (2013: €236 billion).
The amendments have therefore been introduced to increase the overall transparency of the collateral framework by specifying the precise criteria that have to be fulfilled by asset-backed securities in addition to the criteria applicable to debt instruments in general.
Another initiative was to simplify the procedures to receive the new €10 banknotes for adaptation purposes.

The decrease in realised gains arising from financial operations in 2013 was due mainly to lower realised price gains generated on the US dollar portfolio.
So far, only a few crude reproductions of euro banknotes have been put into circulation and were detected without difficulty.
The new distribution of the NCBs’ shares in the ECB’s capital key is set out in the table attached to this press release.

This reduction was partially offset by securities purchased under the third covered bond purchase programme and the ABSPP which commenced in late 2014 and amounted to €31.3 billion at the year-end.
There has been no significant change to the overall distribution pattern: as in previous half years, 97% of counterfeits in circulation were found in the euro area; a further 1% came from other EU Member States outside the euro area; and 2% came from the “rest of the world”, mainly from countries neighbouring the EU.
The reference value for monetary growth is an important part of the first pillar of the strategy, which assigns a prominent role to the analysis of monetary developments.
The Governing Council had no objections to the proposed candidate, Mr José Manuel González-Páramo, who is a person of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters, as required by Article 112 (2) (b) of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
During the first six months of this year (i.e. since the euro banknotes and coins were first put into circulation) 21,965 counterfeit euro banknotes were recorded.
In accordance with Article 49.3 of the Statute of the ESCB, which was added to the Statute by the Treaty of Accession, the ECB’s subscribed capital is automatically increased when a new Member State joins the EU and its NCB joins the ESCB.
When paying at the point of sale, card payments should be used, instead of less efficient means of payment, both for national and SEPA-wide transactions.
They include games such as a domino, a shopping simulation game, a card game and brochures such as an easy-to-read brochure, a cartoon and a guide for budget keeping.
The Grossmarkthalle serves as the ECB’s main entrance and public area, and is linked to the two office towers by the conference centre in the “groundscraper”.
Studies show that countries that make a higher number of card and other electronic retail payments incur significantly lower social costs for their retail payment services as a percentage of GDP.

Accounting policies of the ECB and the Eurosystem: Common accounting policies have been established by the Governing Council for the Eurosystem, including the ECB, in accordance with Article 26.4 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (Statute of the ESCB), and have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union. [2] Although generally based on internationally accepted accounting practice, these policies are designed with special regard to the unique circumstances of the central banks of the Eurosystem.
The vast majority of the costs incurred in connection with the construction of the ECB’s new premises have been capitalised and are excluded from this item.
With regard to the second measure on the acceptability of non-regulated markets, a preliminary list of accepted non-regulated markets was published by the ECB on 10 May 2004 (see the press release “Review of the Eurosystem’s Collateral Framework: First step towards a Single List”).
The new Regulation will include a number of essential enhancements to the statistical requirements.
Excluding the interest income of €2,004 million earned on the share of banknotes in circulation, net interest income amounted to €417 million, compared with €653 million in 2006.
Such measures, together with stability-oriented macroeconomic policies, will help to achieve an environment conducive to sustainable price stability, as well as promote competitiveness and employment growth.
Finally, considerable progress has been made in the fields of e-payments and mobile payments.
In the context of the review of the reference value, the Governing Council wishes to recall the following features of the reference value and its role in the ECB's monetary policy strategy.
For media enquiries, please contact Elodie Nowodazkij, tel.: +49 69 1344 7390.
The Governing Council deeply regrets these developments and shares the views made public by the Commission on the ECOFIN Council conclusions.
In 2008 this remuneration resulted in an interest expense of €1,400 million.
As Estonia has no harmonised long-term interest rate, this value was calculated by adding two percentage points to the unweighted arithmetic average of the long-term interest rates of the two other EU countries entering the calculation of the reference value for the criterion on price stability with a harmonised long-term interest rate, namely Belgium (3.8)% and Portugal (4.2)%.
During the period from March 2015 to June 2016, all counterparties will be able to borrow additional amounts in a series of TLTROs conducted quarterly.
Onsite analyses of original building elements and materials of the Grossmarkthalle were conducted with a view to developing appropriate methods of restoration.

All euro area NCBs are required to follow these policies for the purpose of reporting their operations as part of the Eurosystem, which are included in the Eurosystem’s weekly consolidated financial statements.
The amendments will apply from 30 May 2005 when the new version of the General Documentation replaces the previous version published in February 2004.
The Eurosystem will, however, continue to provide the bulk of liquidity through its main refinancing operations.
The ECB’s regular income derives mainly from investment earnings on its foreign reserve assets and its own funds portfolio, from interest income on its 8% share of the total euro banknotes in circulation, and from net interest income arising from securities purchased for monetary policy purposes under the covered bond purchase programme (starting from July 2009) and the Securities Markets Programme (starting from May 2010).
For all other 3,500 banks the ECB will also set and monitor the supervisory standards and work closely with the national competent authorities in the supervision of these banks.

In the public sector, SEPA could be used as a platform to drive e-Government, thus contributing to the efficient delivery of public services.
However, the Eurosystem, i.e. the European Central Bank (ECB) and the 13 national central banks of the euro area, continues to advise the public to be alert and to check the authenticity of banknotes they receive.
It requires to anticipate how modern payment systems will look at the end of the decade and a continuous improvement of service levels.
Sound fiscal policies and a monetary policy geared to price stability are fundamental for the success of Economic and Monetary Union.
The main construction work will commence in October 2008, with finalisation scheduled for before the end of 2011.
The other denominations – from €5 to €200 – will remain in place.
The various invitations to tender will also be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be reduced by 1 percentage point to 3.5%, effective 9 April 1999.
The European Central Bank (ECB) is today publishing its Convergence Report 2014, which assesses the progress made by eight Member States of the European Union (EU) in fulfilling their obligations regarding the achievement of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
Notes
Restoring competitiveness and boosting potential growth remains critical to the programme’s success.
Several studies have provided empirical evidence in support of this role and confirm that the conditions for announcing a reference value (stable money demand relationship and leading indicator properties of M3 for future inflation) are satisfied for the euro area.
The recent pick-up in the rate of growth of M3 can be explained partly as an adjustment of M3 following a sharp increase in the price level resulting from the oil and food price shocks in the euro area and partly as a consequence of the effects of portfolio shifts.
Meetings of the General Council of the ECB in 2012
Lithuania joined the exchange rate mechanism with its existing currency board arrangement in place as a unilateral commitment.
The SSM-related fees for 2015 amounted to €277 million (Nov-Dec 2014: €30 million).
Very soon, credit transfers and direct debits in euro will follow the same schemes throughout Europe.
A video entitled “Discover the new €20 banknote” in 23 European Union languages provides further information on the new note and how to check it.
The Governing Council decided to reconfirm the existing reference value for monetary growth, namely an annual growth rate of 4 1/2% for the broad aggregate M3.
These interest rates will be used to assess the degree of convergence of these countries, as required under Article 121 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (the Treaty).
“I am very confident that we will continue the very good cooperation between all parties that has characterised this project so far.
