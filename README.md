Project 22 - NMT (s144873, s151149, s155262)
The Jupyter Notebook file is not optimised for viewing on github, and should be opened with Jupyter.
Checkpoints, models and the tensorflow NMT implementations have been omitted, as they are large in size. Feel free to install the tensorflow NMT git repo, and download a working model from the website.
